## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Kotlin** – A modern, concise, and powerful language for Android.
- **Jetpack Compose** – A declarative UI framework for creating native Android interfaces.
- **Ktor** – A lightweight asynchronous framework for network operations.
- **Koin** – A simple and intuitive DI library for Kotlin.
- **Coroutines** – Enables non-blocking, asynchronous programming.
- **MVVM + Clean Architecture** – Promotes maintainability, testability, and clear separation of concerns.

## 🧱 Architecture

The project is based on **MVVM** layered with **Clean Architecture**, ensuring clean separation and better modularity:

- **Presentation Layer** – UI composed with Jetpack Compose and managed through ViewModels.
- **Domain Layer** – Contains business logic, use cases, and core models.
- **Data Layer** – Handles repositories, data sources, and networking logic.
- **DI Layer** – Manages dependency setup using Koin modules.

### Key Advantages

- **Separation of Concerns** – Makes the codebase easier to navigate and manage.
- **Fully Testable** – Each component is isolated and independently testable.
- **Highly Scalable** – Easily supports new features without disrupting core logic.
- **Cleaner Codebase** – Designed with maintainability and readability in mind.
